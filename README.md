# te-balancer-amms
Repository for containing all my working documents for the TE Balancer AMM research group

## NOTE:
Ideally the codebase would reference the balancerv2cad python library found [here](https://github.com/metavisionlabs/balancerv2cad), however I temporarily copied in the codebase with some modifications to particular methods to fit my needs.
I would like to revert back to referencing the library again in the future.

### Notebooks
